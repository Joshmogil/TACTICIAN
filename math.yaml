  phase_4:
    name: "Calculus That Isn’t Soul-Crushing"
    books:
      - title: "Calculus"
        author: "Michael Spivak"
        why: "Formal and human-readable. Teaches real calculus with proofs."
        usage: "Go slow. Use Khan Academy as backup when stuck."

      - title: "Calculus Made Easy"
        author: "Silvanus Thompson (Martin Gardner edition)"
        why: "Demystifies limits, derivatives, integrals. Good companion to Spivak."
        usage: "Skim lightly alongside deeper study for intuition boosts."

  bonus:
    name: "Mental Math and Modeling Like a Monster"
    books:
      - title: "The Art of Problem Solving, Volume 1: The Basics"
        author: "Richard Rusczyk & Sandor Lehoczky"
        why: "Trains clever problem-solving and structural tricks. Great for real-world applications."
        usage: "Use to build flexibility and creativity in problem solving."

      - title: "Mathematics for the Nonmathematician"
        author: "Morris Kline"
        why: "Historical + conceptual. Makes math feel alive and relevant."
        usage: "Read when you feel burned out—rekindles the fire."
