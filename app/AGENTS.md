To recommend more substantial workouts, the following ideas could be explored:

    Configurable decay rates

        Allow different half‑life settings per movement or muscle so recovery speed can be tuned based on intensity or personal fitness.

        Store a default half‑life globally, but permit overrides for specific movements.

        Example: heavy compound movements could decay slower (e.g., 72 hr half-life) while smaller muscles or cardio could recover faster.

    Rich fatigue modeling

        Instead of a single exponential decay, model separate fatigue curves for muscular endurance vs. pure strength.

        Track overall session workload, perceived exertion, and expected recovery; heavier sessions would slow recovery more than lighter ones.

        Possibly combine linear or logarithmic components with the existing exponential decay to reflect both short‑term neural fatigue and longer‑term muscular fatigue.

    Expected workload tracking

        Keep rolling weekly volume totals by movement or muscle and compare them against a configurable target (e.g., minimum effective volume).

        When recommending exercises, boost volume or number of sets if the user is below the expected workload for that movement, rather than just repeating the previous average.

        This encourages progressive overload and prevents under-prescription like single sets of crunches.

    History weighting

        Weight recent sessions more heavily when averaging reps/weights to accelerate progress recommendations.

        Consider trending workload upward when fatigue is low by incrementing reps or sets rather than maintaining the exact historical average.

    Personalization options

        Let users specify desired training frequency or total weekly session volume. Use these preferences to adjust recommendation scoring so the output aligns with personal goals.

        Combine subjective readiness (e.g., user feedback after a workout) with objective fatigue to refine recommendations.

    Data-driven volume adjustments

        Analyze historical patterns to estimate how much the user can handle per session when they are fully recovered.

        If they consistently complete more than the recommended sets with ease, automatically scale up future recommendations.

By incorporating configurable recovery rates, richer fatigue calculations, and target workload tracking, the recommendation system can provide more robust guidance and avoid undertraining suggestions. This also creates room for progressive overload and a more personalized training plan that better reflects how much work the user should aim for in each session.
